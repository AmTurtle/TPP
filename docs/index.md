Additive is a simple, super fast Optifine alternative modpack. It has a ton of the features you know and love from Optifine, like shaders, resource pack features, capes, and great optimization. This pack is way faster than Optifine, and can even reach up to ten times the framerate.

### Extreme Optimization!
This pack is built off my performance modpack [Adrenaline](https://intergrav.github.io/Adrenaline/). It can reach up to **ten times** the framerate, and has a few other performance fixes. Go check it out for more information.

If you just want performance - no quality of like mods - check it out.

### Optifine Features!
This pack has most of Optifine's key features. Heres a few:
* Ultimate performance boost (**up to ten times!**)
* Optifine resource pack features*
* Shader packs*
* Dynamic lighting
* Better grass and snow
* Optifine capes
* Many other key Optifine features

*Most. Sometimes, parts of packs won't load properly or just break.

### Very Quick Updates!
I try to update to newer Minecraft versions as **fast as possible**. The Modrinth page explains how the versioning works, so go onto there and read if you want to.

### Why Switch?
> OptiFine was originally a great mod offering many quality of life improvements for player in the beginning. However, over the years, its benefits have dwindled and has caused many issues for modders. This is due to Minecraft's codebase improving over the years and OptiFine's aggressiveness towards replacing entire swaths of code while being closed source making it very difficult to figure out why OptiFine has broken another modder's mod. Also worth noting that OptiFine natively doesn't support Fabric and it's hard to maintain OptiFabric.

This was stated by [LambdAurora](https://github.com/LambdAurora/optifine_alternatives).

## Can I make a modpack with this publicly?
Yes, *you can*! Feel free to use this in any way you want! If you are making something public with this like a modpack, all I ask for is credit somewhere. You don't **have** to give credit - after all it's just a Minecraft modpack, but I spend lots of time maintaining this and it would help a ton. If you do want to give credit, just put this website in there.

## How do I install it?
Here is a quick video that shows you how to install it. The process should be very similar on most launchers. **Make sure you have all the dependencies for it**! all are linked in the description of the video.

These instructions were made for Adrenaline, but both are installed the exact same way. Just search Additive instead of Adrenaline.
