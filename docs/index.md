Additive is a simple, super-fast Optifine alternative modpack. It has a ton of the features you know and love from Optifine, like shaders, great optimization, resource pack features, zoom, capes. This pack is way faster than Optifine, and can even reach up to ten times the framerate.

## ‚ûï Features
### üî• Extreme Optimization!
This pack is built off my performance modpack [Adrenaline](https://intergrav.github.io/Adrenaline/). It can reach up to **ten times** the framerate and has a few other performance fixes. Go check it out for more information.

If you just want performance - no quality-of-life mods - check that out.

### üîç Optifine Features!
This pack has most of Optifine's key features. Heres a few:
* Ultimate performance boost (**up to ten times!**)
* Optifine resource pack features*
* Shader packs*
* Dynamic lighting
* Better grass and snow
* Optifine capes
* Many other key Optifine features

*Most. Sometimes, parts of packs won't load properly or just break.

### ‚è© Very Quick Updates!
I try to update to newer Minecraft versions as **fast as possible**.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
### üí° Why Switch?
> OptiFine was originally a great mod offering many quality of life improvements for player in the beginning. However, over the years, its benefits have dwindled and has caused many issues for modders. This is due to Minecraft's codebase improving over the years and OptiFine's aggressiveness towards replacing entire swaths of code while being closed source making it very difficult to figure out why OptiFine has broken another modder's mod. Also worth noting that OptiFine natively doesn't support Fabric and it's hard to maintain OptiFabric.

This was stated by [LambdAurora](https://github.com/LambdAurora/optifine_alternatives).

### üîß How do I install it?
Here is a quick video that shows you how to install it. The process should be very similar on most launchers. **Make sure you have all the dependencies for it**! all are linked in the description of the video.

This tutorial was made for Adrenaline, but you install it the same way.

### üì¶ Can I make a modpack with this?
Yes, *you can*! Feel free to use this in any way you want! If you are making something public with this like a modpack, all I ask for is credit somewhere. You don't **have** to give credit - after all it's just a Minecraft modpack, but I spend lots of time maintaining this and it would help a ton. If you do want to give credit, just put this website in there.

### üí¨ How can I provide feedback?
If you want to talk about the pack or have any questions, please use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/36Tv44cYte)! However, if you are asking for a feature to be added or giving a bug report, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/issues) instead. Thanks!

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Versioning
Modpack versions for older MC versions will try to replicate the latest stable version. This makes it super simple, but older versions may have **less features** as many mods can be missing.

This goes for newer, alpha versions as well. However, they will continue to be updated with multiple alpha stages until it has the same mods as the previous version.

For simplicity, I attempt to follow Minecraft's version naming scheme: **1**.**X**.**Y**.
* **1** is just there. I don't know why, but it is.
* **X** is the release. This means adding/removing mods. These won't be made too often.
* **Y** is the patch for that release. This can be updating mods, changing config files, or any other small fix. These will be made often.

<details>
<summary>Actively Updated Versions</summary>

Here are the actively updated versions. Versions that aren't listed here will still be updated, but only for **major** updates. *Latest stable* means it is the pack that all other versions are based off.

* 1.19.1 (alpha)
* 1.19 (latest stable)
* 1.18.2
* 1.17.1
* 1.16.5
