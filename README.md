## About

This is a modpack I work on in my spare time that can be used as a replacement for Optifine. It has great performance, many of the resourcepack features Optifine offers, and best of all, shaders! It's built off my other project [Adrenaline](https://intergrav.github.io/Adrenaline/) for maximized performance, boosting your game's framerate up to 10 times.
