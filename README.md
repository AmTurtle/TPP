Additive is a simple OptiFine alternative modpack. It has many of the features you know and love from OptiFine, like shaders, high optimization, resource pack features, zoom, capes, and more. This pack is built from my other project, [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), which is what gives it the optimizations. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl7nzdbG1GI) by [BillyDaBongo](https://www.youtube.com/c/BillyDaBongo) that explains what Additive is, how to install it, and other modpacks like Simply Optimized.

## üì• Installation guide

If you would like to install the modpack, go to this page on [the website](https://additive.intergrav.xyz/downloads). After you install, you can figure out how to tweak things to give greater optimizations in the [post-install](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Post-install) section of the wiki. This includes procedures such as increasing your allocated memory, tweaking your game settings for your device, and some more advanced stuff such as changing your Java runtime and JVM flags.

## ‚ûï Features

### üî• Performance

Through various optimization mods and mod configurations, Additive can cause your game to reach quite high framerates. This also causes a big decrease in startup times, world loading times, and more. From my testing, Additive can sometimes reach up to 9x the framerate as compared to having no mods.

### üîç OptiFine features

Additive is designed as an open-source and modular alternative to OptiFine, offering many of the same features, including but not limited to:

- Large performance boost
- OptiFine resource pack features
- Shader packs
- Dynamic lighting
- Better grass and snow
- OF donator capes (and [free capes](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Supporter-cape))
- Many other key OptiFine features

To see the full list of OptiFine features, check out [this wiki page](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine).

### üåé World hosting

The modpack includes [World Host](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-host) by [Gaming32](https://github.com/Gaming32), which allows you to host your world in a free, unobtrusive, simple and privacy-respecting way, similar to Essential's world hosting feature. The other side does not need to have Additive installed - they can connect with anything. Simply click "Open Externally" in the menu, and send the given domain to your friends. For more instructions and information, view the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-host).

## ‚ùì Why this over OptiFine?

OptiFine used to be the go-to solution for enhancing performance in Minecraft and offered many additional features that users loved. However, recent developments have changed the situation. OptiFine functions as a type of "all-in-one" mod, making it impossible to disable certain features that are incompatible with other mods. Additionally, its closed-source nature presents a challenge for modders who are unable to fix compatibility issues. OptiFine is not natively compatible with Fabric and requires a separate mod, OptiFabric, which is difficult to keep up to date. This has led to the creation of alternative mods that work just as well, if not better, and are easier to update. Additive usually updates much quicker than OptiFine does. While the transition may take some time to get used to, the overall experience is much improved compared to OptiFine.

For a full list of currently supported features, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine).

## ‚úÖ Compatibility

Additive is designed to be compatible with a wide range of devices, even those with low specifications. This makes it an accessible option with varying hardware configurations. The pack is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac. Additionally, Additive is much more compatible with other mods as compared to OptiFine, thanks to its more flexible design and native compatibility with Fabric.

For players with very low-spec devices, I recommend using my other project, [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline/), a modpack specifically designed for optimization. Unlike other modpacks that may include extra, non-essential mods, Adrenaline prioritizes performance over anything else, making it the ideal choice for limited hardware resources.

## üîÑÔ∏è Updates quickly

My goal is to keep Additive up-to-date with the latest Minecraft releases, providing tested builds as soon as possible. Although the maintenance of the pack is solely done by me, I will make every effort to release updates promptly. However, please note that there may be some delays due to my limited time and motivation.

**‚û°Ô∏è Note:** This does not apply to snapshots most of the time. I do not bother as they can sometimes require lots of maintenance and come out too quickly. If I recall correctly, [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) sometimes has updates for snapshots, so feel free to check that out if you really need them.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

Additive utilizes a variety of optimization mods that are designed to work seamlessly together. Many of these mods have been adjusted to provide improved performance beyond their standard settings, and this has proven to be effective. It's important to note that, compared to some other modpacks, Additive may be more aggressive in its optimizations and can sometimes result in instability. However, these instances are rare and the overall result will be an improvement in performance compared to other modpacks. To replicate the features of OptiFine, Additive uses mods such as LambDynamicLights, LambdaBetterGrass, Zoomify, Iris, CIT resewn, and many others.

## üêõ Reporting Issues

Experiencing bugs, crashes, or other issues? Feel free to open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/issues). Sometimes this may be an issue with Adrenaline and not Additive itself, so I will move the issue accordingly if needed.
