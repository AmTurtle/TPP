# Some parts of this config file are taken from Simply Optimized 1.20.4-3.4. C2ME is not shipped with
# Adrenaline by default, however this serves it's place if the user adds the mod manually.

# I've disabled C2ME's experimental GC-free chunk serializer.
# 
# Thanks HyperSoop for allowing me to modify the config file for Adrenaline :)
